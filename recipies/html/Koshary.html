		<h2>Brief introduction:</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Koshari</strong> is an Egyptian dish that has been around
			for centuries. It’s considered the national dish of Egypt (very big
			deal for a simple recipe!) and one of the most popular<em>
				street foods</em
			>
			in Cairo, Alexandria, and other major cities.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <strong>history</strong> of the dish is a bit of a
			<em>mystery</em> and some people argue that it was brought to Egypt
			by the Ottomans during their rule in the late 1800s. While koshary
			is very popular with students, who can often be seen eating at
			street food carts on college campuses, it’s a dish that can be
			enjoyed by people of all ages.
